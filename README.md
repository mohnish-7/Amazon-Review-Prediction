# Amazon-Review-Prediction
This project aims to classify an Amazon review, or any review in general, as a positive or a negative review. The software uses Natural Language Processing and a Machine Learning model to classify the review into positive or negative. To be precise, the ML model uses the Linear SVC ( Linear Support Vector Classification ) algorithm. The reviews are converted to tokens, using the Natural Language Processing toolkit, and are fit on the ML model. This model has an accuracy of 92.19858% .

Feel free to send your feedbacks and suggestions to mohnish_official@icloud.com

P.S. Even though this project can be made using Sentiment Analysis, using Linear SVC provides a better accuracy score.
